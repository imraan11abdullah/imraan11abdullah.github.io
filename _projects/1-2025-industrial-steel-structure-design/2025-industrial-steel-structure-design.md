## Project Introduction
This project involved the **full structural engineering design of an industrial steel
building**, undertaken as a year-long industry project and delivered across
**Part A (concept and interim design)** and **Part B (final detailed engineering design)**.

The scope covered the complete engineering workflow:
- Structural system selection
- Load derivation (gravity, wind, earthquake)
- SAP2000 analysis and verification
- Governing ULS identification
- Steel member and connection design
- Foundation design and layout coordination

---

## Building Description & Function
The development is a **steel-framed industrial facility**, designed to support
industrial operations requiring:
- Large open internal spaces
- Efficient long-span framing
- Robust performance under lateral actions
- Practical and buildable foundations

The structure was designed to ensure clear load paths from roof and floor systems,
through steel members, and into the foundations.

## Architectural & Structural Form
The overall building form and layout were developed prior to structural analysis to
define member spans, tributary areas, and load paths.

## Part A – Concept & Interim Structural Design
Part A established the **structural strategy**, preliminary sizing, and initial analytical
model.

## Structural Analysis Model (SAP2000)
A full **3D SAP2000 model** was developed to analyse the structure under combined
gravity, wind, and earthquake loading.

The model included:
- Steel beams and columns
- Boundary conditions and restraints
- Mass distribution based on tributary areas
- Load cases per NZS 1170

## Load Assessment (NZS 1170)

### Dead and Live Loads
Dead loads included:
- Structural steel self-weight (auto-generated in SAP2000)
- Permanent building components

Live loads were applied in accordance with **NZS 1170.1** for industrial occupancy.

Load on members was calculated using tributary area methods:

Q = q × Aₜ

---

### Wind and Earthquake Loads
Wind actions were calculated in accordance with **NZS 1170.2**, while seismic actions
were derived per **NZS 1170.5**.

Earthquake base shear:

V = C(T) × Wₜ  

Vertical distribution:

Fᵢ = V × (Wᵢ × hᵢ) / Σ(W × h)

---

## Load Combinations & Governing ULS Case
A full set of **ULS and SLS load combinations** was assessed.

## Steel Member Design (AS 4100)
Steel members were designed in accordance with **AS 4100**.

Combined axial–bending interaction:

(N* / φN_c) + (M* / φM_b) ≤ 1.0
