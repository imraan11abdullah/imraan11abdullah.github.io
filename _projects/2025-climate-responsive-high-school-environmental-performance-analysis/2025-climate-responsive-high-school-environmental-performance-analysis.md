## Project Overview

**Course:** ENBU808 – Construction Technology (Semester 2, 2025)  
**Location:** Tamaki Drive, Orakei, Auckland (36.85° S)  
**Building Type:** Two-storey senior high school  
**Total Floor Area:** ~3,000 m²  

**Climate:** Warm-temperate oceanic (Cfb) — Summer avg. 23°C; Winter avg. 11°C; ~2,000 annual sunshine hours; prevailing westerly winds 6–12 m/s.

## North-Facing Classroom Orientation

All classrooms oriented to **true north (0° azimuth)** to maximize consistent daylight without glare.

**Solar Geometry:**
- Summer: Sun altitude 76° at midday
- Winter: Sun altitude 30° at midday
- North glazing receives stable, indirect light year-round while avoiding direct beam radiation during school hours (9am–3pm)

## Angled Shed Roof and Overhangs

**Geometry:**
- Roof pitch: 7–10°
- Overhang: 4.0 m on north, east, west façades

**Performance:**
- Summer: Blocks sun at 76° altitude; reduces solar gain by ~65%
- Winter: Permits sun at 30° altitude; allows passive heating

## Incident Radiation Analysis

Ladybug simulation analyzed cumulative solar exposure (kWh/m²) across all building surfaces during summer (Dec–Feb).

**Results:**

| Surface | Radiation (kWh/m²) | Performance Notes |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Roof | 60-66 | 27% reduction vs. flat roof |
| North façade | 45–50 | Overhang protection effective |
| East/West | 35–42 | Louvres reduce morning/afternoon gain |
| South | 25–30 | Minimal exposure |

The angled shed roof geometry reduced peak radiation while maintaining adequate winter solar access for passive heating.

## Direct Sunlight Hours – Seasonal Analysis

Direct sunlight hour simulations assessed year-round solar exposure across building envelope using Ladybug Tools.

**Simulation Parameters:**
- Grid resolution: 0.5 m × 0.5 m
- Analysis period: Full calendar year
- Calculation: Hourly sun vector analysis

**Seasonal Results:**

| Season | Roof Exposure (hrs) | Design Response |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------|
| **Summer** | 98-123 | Overhangs block high-angle sun (76°) |
| **Autumn/Spring** | 80–100 | Balanced exposure across orientations |
| **Winter** | 60–80 | Lower sun (30°) penetrates for passive heating |

The tiered roof structure and deep overhangs effectively balance direct sun exposure across seasons, preventing overheating in summer while allowing beneficial solar gain in winter.

## Daylight Factor Optimization

**Target:** 5–8% Daylight Factor (DF) per CIBSE standards for learning environments.

**Iterative Design Refinement:**

| Configuration | Average DF | Glare Risk | Outcome |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| No roof / No louvres | 9–12% | High (>10% at perimeter) | Excessive glare and heat gain |
| Shed roof only | 6–9% | Moderate | Improved but inconsistent |
| **Shed roof + louvres** | **5–8%** | **Low** | **Optimal performance** |

**Louvre Specification:**
- Blade depth: 150 mm
- Spacing: 300 mm center-to-center
- Material: Powder-coated aluminum

**Final Performance:**
- First floor: 5–8% DF across 85% of floor area
- Second floor: 6–8% DF with controlled perimeter zones
- Estimated 40% reduction in artificial lighting energy consumption

## Climate Analysis – Temperature and Wind

**Annual Dew Point Temperature:**
- Summer peaks: 18–21°C (high humidity periods)
- Winter lows: 6–10°C (drier conditions)
- Design response: Natural ventilation and roof overhangs manage moisture and thermal comfort without heavy mechanical cooling

**Annual Wind Speed:**
- Prevailing westerly and south-westerly winds: 6–12 m/s
- Peak gusts: 16 m/s during storm events
- Building orientation and façade openings enhance cross-ventilation through central spaces while maintaining sheltered outdoor areas

The form, shading, and ventilation strategies align with Auckland's climatic conditions, delivering year-round comfort and reduced reliance on mechanical systems.

## First Floor Plan

**Key Features:**
- **Multiple Entry Points:** Three entrance locations (marked with red arrows) prevent congestion during peak arrival/dismissal times
- **Staff Wing:** Offices and meeting rooms acoustically isolated on east side for privacy and focus
- **Library Placement:** Positioned near main entrance; allows community access without disrupting student circulation
- **North-Facing Classrooms:** Maximum daylight access with controlled glare and bay views
- **Ceiling Height:** Consistent 3.5 m throughout for improved natural ventilation and acoustic performance

**Circulation Strategy:**
- Primary route: Front entry → courtyard → main lobby → classrooms
- Secondary route: Rear entry → back lobby → staff wing
- Tertiary route: North-side entry → main corridor → direct classroom access

## Second Floor Plan

**Key Features:**
- **Event Room:** 5 m ceiling height for assemblies, exhibitions, and multi-purpose functions
- **Cafeteria:** 8 m total height (double-height space) with skylight providing natural illumination and unobstructed bay views
- **Glass Skywalk:** Connects building wings; eliminates need to traverse entire perimeter while providing scenic, light-filled circulation path
- **North-Facing Classrooms:** Consistent orientation with ground floor; maximizes daylight and coastal landscape connection

**Vertical Circulation:**
- Main staircase (front lobby): Primary student and visitor access
- Secondary staircase (rear): Staff circulation and service access
- Emergency egress designed per NZS 4541 (Automatic Fire Systems) compliance

The second floor spatial arrangement prioritizes natural light, views, and efficient movement while supporting diverse educational activities.

## Building Sections

Section cuts reveal the integrated environmental control strategy through roof geometry, window placement, and spatial volumes.

**Key Section Elements:**
1. Angled shed roof with 4 m overhangs for seasonal solar control
2. Clerestory windows strategically placed for deep daylight penetration
3. Floor-to-floor heights: 3.5 m (ground floor); variable 3.5–8 m (second floor for event room and cafeteria)
4. Central courtyard enabling passive ventilation and thermal stack effect

These sections demonstrate how passive strategies combine to deliver thermal comfort and natural illumination without mechanical systems.
