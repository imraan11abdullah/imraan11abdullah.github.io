## Project Overview
This project was completed in 2022 as part of the *Intro to Engineering Design* course
under the Engineers Without Borders (EWB) Challenge. The objective was to design a
practical, affordable, and manually operated weed control multi-tool suitable for use
in environments where access to advanced equipment and resources is limited.

The project emphasised **human-centred design**, ensuring that usability, safety, and
context-specific constraints were central to the engineering decision-making process.

## Project Objectives & Constraints
The key objectives of the project included:

- Developing a manually operated weed removal solution  
- Minimising cost and material complexity  
- Ensuring safe and ergonomic operation  
- Designing for ease of manufacture and maintenance  

Primary constraints considered during the design process were:

- Limited access to manufacturing infrastructure  
- Variation in user strength and experience  
- Environmental durability and robustness  

---

## Engineering Design Approach
A structured engineering design methodology was followed throughout the project:

1. Problem definition and contextual analysis  
2. Stakeholder and user needs assessment  
3. Concept generation and comparison  
4. Preliminary material selection  
5. Iterative refinement of the selected concept  

Design decisions were guided by practicality, affordability, and alignment with the
intended user context.

---

## Design Development & Analysis
Multiple design concepts were developed and evaluated against criteria such as
functionality, manufacturability, ergonomics, durability, and cost. The final concept
integrated multiple weed-removal functions into a single tool to improve efficiency and
reduce reliance on specialised equipment.

Basic engineering judgement and analysis were applied to assess structural adequacy,
material suitability, and functional performance of the proposed design.

## Outcomes & Deliverables
The final project deliverables included:

- A complete engineering design report  
- Concept sketches and refined design drawings  
- A justified final design solution aligned with project objectives and constraints  

The final design demonstrated a balanced response to technical, social, and practical
considerations.

## Key Learnings
This project provided valuable early exposure to:

- Applying the engineering design process to real-world problems  
- The importance of human-centred design in engineering solutions  
- Working within constraints to develop realistic and implementable designs  
- Communicating technical ideas clearly through structured engineering reports
