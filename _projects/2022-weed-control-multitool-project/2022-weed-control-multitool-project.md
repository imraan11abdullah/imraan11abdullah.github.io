## Project Overview
This project was completed in 2022 as part of the *Intro to Engineering Design* course
under the Engineers Without Borders (EWB) Challenge. The objective was to design a
practical, affordable, and manually operated weed control multi-tool suitable for use
in environments where access to advanced equipment and resources is limited.

The project placed a strong emphasis on **human-centred design**, ensuring usability,
safety, and contextual constraints informed all engineering decisions.

---

## Project Objectives & Constraints
The key objectives of the project included:

- Developing a manually operated weed removal solution  
- Minimising cost and material complexity  
- Ensuring safe and ergonomic operation  
- Designing for ease of manufacture and maintenance  

Key constraints considered:
- Limited access to manufacturing infrastructure  
- Variation in user strength and experience  
- Environmental durability and robustness  

---

## Engineering Design Approach
A structured engineering design methodology was followed throughout the project:

1. Problem definition and contextual analysis  
2. Stakeholder and user needs assessment  
3. Concept generation and evaluation  
4. Preliminary material selection  
5. Iterative refinement of the selected concept  

Design decisions prioritised practicality, affordability, and real-world usability.

## Design Development & CAD Modelling
Design concepts were progressively developed using **SolidWorks**, allowing key
geometric features, functional mechanisms, and overall ergonomics to be visualised and
refined prior to final selection.

SolidWorks was used to:
- Develop and iterate design concepts  
- Assess form, fit, and basic functionality  
- Produce supporting drawings for communication

## Additional SolidWorks Skill Development
Alongside this project, extensive independent SolidWorks practice was undertaken to
build confidence in 3D modelling and design intent through modelling a wide range of
geometric forms and components.

## Outcomes & Deliverables
The final deliverables included:
- A complete engineering design report  
- Concept sketches and CAD-supported design drawings  
- A justified final design aligned with project objectives and constraints  

---

## Key Learnings
This project provided early exposure to:
- Applying the engineering design process to real-world problems  
- The role of human-centred design in engineering solutions  
- Developing CAD skills using SolidWorks  
- Communicating technical ideas clearly through structured reports
