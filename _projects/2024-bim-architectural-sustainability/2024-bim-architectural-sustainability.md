## Project Overview
This project was completed in 2024 as part of the *Architectural Design and Sustainability*
course (ENBU700). The project focused on developing a **BIM-based architectural design**
supported by a **critical passive design and sustainability analysis**.

The **final report** was the primary deliverable and documented the design intent,
environmental strategies, and performance considerations across the building.

## BIM Design Communication
Building Information Modelling was used as the primary tool to communicate design
intent and coordinate architectural elements.

The BIM model supported:
- Site planning and building orientation  
- Floor plan development and spatial layout  
- 3D visualisation and rendered views  
- Clear communication of architectural design decisions

## 3D Modelling & Visualisation
A series of rendered views were produced to demonstrate how the building performs
across different seasons and times of day. These views supported analysis of daylight,
solar exposure, and spatial quality.

## Passive Design & Indoor Environmental Quality
The design prioritised indoor environmental quality through passive design strategies
addressing:

- **Light comfort** through window placement, glazing selection, and orientation  
- **Thermal comfort** using high-performance insulation, cross ventilation, and heat pumps  
- **Indoor air quality** via raised foundation design, damp-proof membranes, and ventilation  
- **Acoustic comfort** through insulation and spatial zoning  

These strategies aimed to reduce reliance on mechanical systems while maintaining
occupant comfort.

## Sun Path & Seasonal Performance Analysis
Sun path analysis was undertaken to evaluate seasonal solar access and shading
performance. Key living spaces were oriented to maximise natural daylight while
limiting unwanted heat gain during warmer periods.

## Sustainability & Ecological Considerations
The project considered the environmental impacts of the building within its local
context, including:

- Energy efficiency and reduced operational demand  
- Responsible material selection  
- Water conservation strategies  
- Minimising ecological disruption within the site  

The design also acknowledged unavoidable environmental impacts and proposed
measures to mitigate them through thoughtful architectural and systems design.

## Outcomes & Key Learnings
This project strengthened practical understanding of:

- Using BIM as a tool for sustainable architectural design  
- Applying passive design principles in residential buildings  
- Evaluating indoor environmental quality holistically  
- Communicating design intent through drawings, models, and technical reports  

The project highlighted the value of integrating BIM and sustainability thinking early
in the design process.
